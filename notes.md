# FreshPlate Development Notes

## Design Considerations
- Mobile-first approach with responsive design for desktop
- Clean, minimalist UI inspired by successful food delivery apps
- Emphasis on high-quality food imagery
- Intuitive onboarding process with progress indicators

## User Flow
1. Landing page with clear value proposition and CTA
2. Quick onboarding:
   a. Location selection
   b. Dietary preferences (optional)
   c. OpenTable integration for restaurant selection
   d. Dish preference selection (3-5 dishes)
3. Subscription options:
   a. Meal frequency
   b. Number of servings
   c. Delivery schedule
4. Payment and account creation
5. Dashboard with upcoming meals and options to modify

## Key Components
- Restaurant search and selection (OpenTable API)
- Dish carousel for preference selection
- Subscription management interface
- Recipe display with ingredients and instructions
- Delivery tracking (Instacart API)

## Technical Challenges
- Integrating and managing multiple APIs (OpenTable, Instacart, LLM)
- Ensuring real-time inventory accuracy with Instacart
- Optimizing recipe generation for available ingredients and user preferences
- Handling subscription logic and recurring payments

## Security Considerations
- Secure API key management for third-party services
- User data protection and GDPR compliance
- Secure payment processing

## Performance Optimization
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data (e.g., popular restaurants, common ingredients)
- Use server-side rendering for initial load and static generation where possible
- Optimize images and implement lazy loading

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core business logic
- Integration tests for API interactions
- E2E tests for critical user flows (onboarding, subscription management)
- A/B testing for onboarding flow optimization

## Monitoring and Analytics
- Implement error tracking and logging
- Set up user behavior analytics
- Monitor API usage and costs

## Launch Strategy
- Soft launch with limited geographic area
- Gather initial user feedback and iterate
- Expand gradually to new markets
