# FreshPlate Project Overview

## Concept
FreshPlate is a personalized meal planning service that combines restaurant-inspired dishes with individual health goals. It utilizes OpenTable for restaurant preferences, AI for recipe generation, and Instacart for ingredient delivery.

## Key Features
1. OpenTable integration for restaurant and dish preferences
2. AI-powered personalized meal plan generation
3. Health goal integration and nutritional planning
4. Automated grocery list creation and Instacart delivery integration
5. User dashboard for meal planning and tracking
6. Subscription management system

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- Backend: Serverless functions (Vercel)
- Database: Firebase Firestore
- APIs: OpenTable, Instacart, OpenAI (or alternative LLM)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS with Shadcn UI components
- Authentication: Firebase Authentication

## System Architecture
1. User Interface Layer (Next.js)
2. Application Layer (Serverless functions)
3. Data Layer (Firebase Firestore)
4. External Services Layer (OpenTable, Instacart, LLM APIs)

## Core Modules
1. User Management
2. Preference Engine
3. Meal Plan Generator
4. Recipe Adapter
5. Grocery List Compiler
6. Delivery Scheduler
7. Subscription Handler

## API Integrations
- OpenTable: Restaurant and menu data
- Instacart: Grocery inventory and delivery
- LLM (e.g., OpenAI): Recipe generation and adaptation

## Data Models
1. User Profile
2. Meal Preferences
3. Health Goals
4. Meal Plans
5. Recipes
6. Grocery Lists
7. Subscriptions

## Security Considerations
- Secure API key management
- User data encryption
- GDPR compliance implementation
- Secure payment processing

## Performance Optimization
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Use server-side rendering and static generation
- Optimize images and implement lazy loading
- Database indexing for frequent queries

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core business logic
- Integration tests for API interactions
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- A/B testing for onboarding flow optimization

## Monitoring and Analytics
- Error tracking and logging (e.g., Sentry)
- User behavior analytics (e.g., Mixpanel)
- API usage and cost monitoring
- Performance monitoring (e.g., New Relic)

## Deployment Strategy
- CI/CD pipeline setup (e.g., GitHub Actions)
- Staging and production environments
- Feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Automated database migrations

## MVP Development Roadmap
1. User authentication and profile creation
2. Restaurant and dish preference selection
3. Basic meal plan generation
4. Grocery list creation
5. Instacart integration for delivery
6. Simple subscription management
7. MVP dashboard for meal viewing and basic modifications

## Future Technical Enhancements
- Machine learning for improved meal recommendations
- Real-time collaborative meal planning
- Integration with smart kitchen appliances
- Advanced dietary restriction handling
- Mobile app development (React Native)

## Scalability Considerations
- Implement database sharding for user data
- Use content delivery networks (CDNs) for static assets
- Implement rate limiting for API calls
- Design for horizontal scaling of serverless functions

## Accessibility and Internationalization
- Implement WCAG 2.1 compliance
- Set up i18n for multi-language support
- Consider right-to-left (RTL) language support

This technical overview provides a solid foundation for the development team to understand the project's architecture, key components, and technical considerations. It focuses on the system's structure, technologies, and development priorities while still maintaining context with the business goals.
